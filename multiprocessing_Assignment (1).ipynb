    "Multiprocessing in Python: Multiprocessing is a technique where multiple processes are created to execute tasks concurrently. In Python, the multiprocessing module allows the creation, synchronization, and communication between separate processes. It is useful when you want to utilize multiple CPU cores to perform tasks in parallel, thus increasing the overall processing speed and efficiency of the program."
